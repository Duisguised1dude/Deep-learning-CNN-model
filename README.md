# Deep-learning-CNN-model

The objective is to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories.. We have used 7 emotions namely - 'Angry'😠, 'Disgust'🤢, 'Fear'😱, 'Happy'😇, 'Neutral'😐, 'Sad'☹️, 'Surprise'😲 to train and test our algorithm using Convolution Neural Networks
You will use OpenCV to automatically detect faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them. Once you have trained, saved, and exported the CNN, you will directly serve the trained model to a web interface and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data. 
For this project, you need Python, Jupyter, Tensorflow, OpenCV and Keras pre-installed. Along with data visualization libraries like numpy, panda, matplotlib, seaborn.
